# 2. Nutrient actual intake vs recommended intake
# @Michael @Johnny
    # Ask users' information:
        # age, gender, date
    # I think your methods should be in the same class in the same python file (Michael_Johnny.py file - please rename it).
    # E.g. NutrientMaster = NutrientMaster()

# 4. Store data into duckdb
# @Tu
# Take the input from step 2 + email + date, save them into duckdb.
# Side note: Either hash(email, date+hour+minute) to ensure that the user does not 
# submit the same dish twicw.
# or ask confirmation from user.
    

# 5. Recommend dish.
# @Anika
# A python class in a separate file (Anika.py - Please rename it), containing different methods:
    # E.g. DishRecommender = DishRecommender()
    # DishRecommender.get_user_preference()
    # DishRecommender.recommend_recipe()
# Ask user's preference (diet/ what do you have left in your fridge?)
